Trace how snippets are structured when passed to depth_aligner.

With 5 frames, snippet_len=3, stride=1:
- Pipeline generates snippets at indices [[0,1,2], [1,2,3], [2,3,4]]
- These are processed and concatenated
- depth_aligner receives the concatenated tensor

The question: What shape does depth_aligner actually receive?
